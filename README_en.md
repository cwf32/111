# MDA

Maa Doro Assistant

**[简体中文](README.md)** | **English**

</div>

MDA is a game automation assistant built on [MaaFramework](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework), rewritten from [DoroHelper](https://github.com/1204244136/DoroHelper).

---

## Member Features

To provide a more stable and efficient automation experience, this project is currently **maintained and updated full-time**. Due to the significant time and effort required for ongoing development, adapting to game updates, and maintaining the project, MDA adopts a **partial features available via sponsorship** model to ensure the long-term healthy development of the project.

Details are as follows:

- **Member Task标识**: In the task list, tasks prefixed with the orange **🍊** marker are exclusive to members.
- **Sponsorship Method**: When you attempt to run any member task marked with 🍊, **a sponsorship link will be automatically displayed in the run log**. You can then sponsor the project through the link.

Thank you to all contributors for their efforts, and to every user for their understanding and support! Your sponsorship is the biggest motivation for me to continuously optimize MDA.

## Language Compatibility

MDA's interface supports multiple languages including Chinese and English, but **the script's functionality is currently only adapted for the Chinese game interface**.

If you are using an English or other language game interface, you may encounter recognition errors or functional issues. If you experience errors, please switch your game to **Simplified Chinese** first and try again. If the problem persists after switching, feel free to submit feedback and I'll help investigate.

## Getting Started

### 1. First Launch

Take a moment to explore the interface before running any tasks to understand the available features and settings.

### 2. Set Up Hotkeys (Recommended)

Go to **Settings (top-right corner) → Hotkeys** and enable global hotkeys, in case the program becomes unresponsive and you need to exit.

## Reporting Issues

If the script encounters an error, follow these steps to collect information for troubleshooting.

### Step 1: Enable Debug Images

1. Go to **Settings → Debug**
2. Enable **Save Debug Images**

> ⚠️ This option must be re-enabled each time you start the program.

### Step 2: Reproduce the Issue

Debug mode saves a screenshot for every action, so **avoid running tasks for extended periods** — it will generate a large number of images and consume disk space.

Recommended approach:

- After enabling debug mode, **only run the task that has the issue**
- Stop immediately after reproducing the problem and prepare to package the logs

### Step 3: Package the Logs

1. Click the **Export Logs** icon next to **Run Log** in the bottom-right corner
2. In the `debug` folder that opens, find the generated archive and **extract it**
3. Drag the **`vision` folder** from the same directory into the extracted folder
4. Verify the folder contains the following:
    - `vision` folder
    - `config` folder
    - `XXXX-XX-XX-X.log`
    - `go-service.log`
    - `maafw.log`
5. **Re-compress** the entire folder as a ZIP file and send it to the developer

> 💡 After submitting feedback, it's recommended to **delete the old `vision` folder** and restart the program. This keeps debug images from different issues separate and makes troubleshooting easier.
